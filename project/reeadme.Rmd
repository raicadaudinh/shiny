Hello, in this document I present how to use my first shiny app!! </br>

This application show us the projection of European Union's and its members' demography from 2015-2060(80) (depend on case). </br>

You can find the data in data folder. The raw data has been downloaded from Eurostat web page </br>
You can choose a country by the select bar. </br>
Then You can choose a scenario for the projection. </br>
The projection changes from a scenario to another.</br>
There are 4 scenarii in total: </br>: main scenario, a scenario when there are no migration, a scenario when we have a higher age expectancy and a scenario with lower fertility rate (poor Europe!!)
